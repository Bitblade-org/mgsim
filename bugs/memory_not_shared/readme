BUG: 

    The architecture simulated in mgsim has cores sharing the same system 
    memory. However, during the simulation the memory contents as seen from 
    different cores differs. It does seem to synchronise when certain functions
    like printf are called. 
    
    
REPRODUCE: 
    N.B. The source for test.bin is included in ./test.c

    - Build mgsim using the configure arguments in ../conf.args
    - Run mgsim using ../config.ini and ./test.bin (NOT ../boot.bin)
