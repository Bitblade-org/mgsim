BUG: 

    Whilst checking of storage traces can be disabled during the configuration
    step, it is not possible to stop the simulator from storing them without
    code modifications. 
    
    This limits the number of IO devices severely, since the number of storage
    traces increases polynomially with the number of IO devices.
    
    
REPRODUCE: 

    - Replace sim/storagetrace.h with ./storagetrace.enabled.h
    - Build mgsim using the configure arguments in ../conf.args
    - Run mgsim using ../config.ini and ../boot.bin
